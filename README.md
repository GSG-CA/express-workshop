# Express Code-Along Workshop ðŸ’»

The workshop is composed of a number of steps with source files included in the individual folders. Before we start, let's go through some information about what Express is and why we use it.

## Introduction to Express
- In summary, express is a minimal and **unopinionated** web framework for Node.
- Express **handles low level functionality of the Node web server** so that you can focus on the business logic of your app.
- Express provides **only a thin layer of abstraction over vanilla Node** `http` server features. If required you can even add vanilla `http` code and it will be compatible with the Express app.
