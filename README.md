# Express Code-Along Workshop ðŸ’»

![express logo](./images/express-logo.png)

The workshop is composed of a number of steps with source files included in the individual folders. Before we start, let's go through some information about what Express is and why we use it.


## Introduction to Express
- In summary, express is a minimal and **unopinionated** web framework for Node.
- Express **handles low level functionality of the Node web server** so that you can focus on the business logic of your app.
- Express provides **only a thin layer of abstraction over vanilla Node** `http` server features. If required you can even add vanilla `http` code and it will be compatible with an Express app.


## Workshop tasks

Let's code along the solutions to the following tasks. A global installation of `nodemon` may be helpful when completing the tasks: `npm i -g nodemon`

1. **Hello world**
    - Task
      - Setup an Express server serving `Hello world` on port 3000
    - Notes
      - Go to Chrome Dev Tools -> Network; and check if the status code is `200` and if the content type is `text/html`
      - Go to Chrome Dev Tools -> Elements; and find `Hello world` in the DOM tree

1. **Hello html**
    - Task
      - Serve the following html
      ```html
      <h1>Hello world</h1><p>Cool</p>
      ```
    - Notes
      - Go to Chrome Dev Tools -> Elements; and check the response in the DOM tree

1. **Hello json**
    - Task
      - Serve the following object as json
      ```js
      { community: 'founders & coders' }
      ```
    - Notes
      - Go to Chrome Dev Tools -> Network; and check if the content type is `application/json`. You may need to hard reload chrome.

1. **Routes to cities**
    - Task
      - Serve `Hello [city name]` (e.g. `Hello London`) on the `/london`, `/nazareth`, `/gaza` paths

1. **One route to cities**
    - Task
      - Serve `Hello [city name]` (e.g. `Hello London`) on the `/london`, `/nazareth`, `/gaza` paths. Use only one route handler to handle the requests.

1. **new-york newyork**
    - Task
      - Serve `Hello New York` on the `/new-york`, `/newyork` paths. Use only one route handler to handle the requests.

1. **My logger middleware**
    - Task
      - Add a logging middleware that logs millisecond timestamp (`Date.now()`) **before** any request to our server is handled.
      - Add a logging middleware that logs millisecond timestamp (`Date.now()`) **after** every request to our server.

1. **Morgan logger middleware**
    - Task
      - Add a `morgan` middleware to log standard Apache combined server log output
      - Save logs in the `access.log` file in the `logs-demo` folder
      - Compare the server logs by trying two different browsers

1. **Static files**
    - Task
      - Serve static files from the `public` folder

1. **Post form data**
    - Task
      - Access form data on the server

1. **Handle errors**
    - Task
      - Serve `page node found` with a status code of 404
      - Serve `internal server error` with a status code of 500, for example when trying to call an undefined function in one of the route handlers

1. **Prepare for production**
    - Tasks
      - Set port number
      - Disable `Powered by express` header' (check headers before and after in Chrome Dev Tools -> Network);
      - Enable compression
      - Let browser know to cache static resources for 30 days.

1. **Split into modules**
    - Tasks
      - Split the app into modules
        1. Create a new starting point: `index.js`
        2. First move routes to the `controllers/index.js` folder
        3. Then seperate routes out into individual files.

        ```
        13-split-into-modules
        â”œâ”€â”€ public
        â””â”€â”€ src
            â””â”€â”€ app.js
            â””â”€â”€ index.js
            â””â”€â”€ controllers
                â””â”€â”€ error.js
                â””â”€â”€ fruit.js
                â””â”€â”€ index.js
        ```


## Tips
    - You can run `nodemon` in a quiet mode with: `nodemon app.js -q`
